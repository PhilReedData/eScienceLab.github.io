The Software Sustainability Institute has been developing the 
[Intermediate Research Software Development Skills In Python](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/) over the past few years. 
This general course (hosted in [The Carpentries Incubator](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/))
teaches intermediate-level software development skills in a way that mimics a typical software engineering and development process in a team, 
starting from an existing piece of software. It continues from the material covered in the novice-level Software Carpentry lessons and follows the same 
teaching principles, as described in Best Practices for Scientific Computing and Good enough practices in scientific computing.

More recently, together with the colleagues from the [Reseach IT at the University of Manchester](https://www.itservices.manchester.ac.uk/research/), a [new course](https://uomresearchit.github.io/python-intermediate-development-nerc/) has been derived specifically suited for 
environmental and atmospheric sciences.
