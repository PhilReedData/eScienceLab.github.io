[Collaborative Lesson Development Training](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/), developed collaboratively by The Carpentries and members of the global Carpentries community 
(including the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://esciencelab.org.uk/projects/ssi/)), is a new training curriculum that teaches good practices in lesson design and development, 
and open source collaboration skills, using The Carpentries Workbench. 

The target audience is Carpentries Instructors with an idea for a new lesson they would like to create, especially if that lesson is intended for 
short-format training (e.g. part or all of a two-day workshop).

Lesson development is easier and more successful when it is a joint effort among collaborators, so the activities and examples used in this training are 
best suited to groups of trainees who want to collaborate on a lesson project. Efforts have been made to also cater to lesson developers working alone.
