[RO-Crate](/products/researchobject/) is s community effort to practically achieve FAIR packaging of research objects (digital objects like data, methods, software) with structured metadata. RO-Crate uses well-established Web standards and FAIR principles. For common metadata representations, RO-Crate builds on schema.org, a mature and general mark-up vocabulary used by search engines including Google Dataset Search. RO-Crate is co-led by eScience Lab and used in several of [our projects](/projects/) as a pragmatic implementation of the FAIR Digital Objects vision.

On collaboration with [ELIXIR](/projects/elixir/), [RO-Crate community](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/community.html) and [Bioschemas community](https://bioschemas.org/community/), we are planning a series of training events on RO-Crate and [Bioschemas](/activities/bioschemas/) in 2023:

* [Galaxy Smörgåsbord 2023](https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/events/smorgasbord3/), virtual, 2023-05-23/--26
  - Module: FAIR data and provenance with RO-Crate and Galaxy
* [ELIXIR All Hands 2023](https://elixir-europe.org/events/elixir-all-hands-2023), Dublin+virtual, 2023-06-05/--08
  - Workshop: [Building lightweight FAIR data packages with Bioschemas and RO-Crate](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vh9mUBWvNEsvC5YZRITtZxsyE6Wr18rJUgp9KweJFNg/edit) 2023-06-06
* [Open Science Festival 2023](https://www.zbmed.de/en/networking/events/open-science-festival), 2023-07-04/–05, Cologne, Germany. 
   - [Workshop: Data Exchange with RO-Crate and Knowledge Graphs](https://www.zbmed.de/vernetzen/veranstaltungen/open-science-festival/data-exchange-with-ro-crates-and-knowledge-graphs) 2023-07-05

In addition we have submitted workshop proposals for:

* [Open Science FAIR](https://www.opensciencefair.eu/), Madrid, 2023-09-25/--27
  - _Lightweight reproducible FAIR data packages: A practical introduction to RO-Crate and schema.org_ (submitted)

The training material will also be made available on the [RO-Crate outreach](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/outreach.html) section.
