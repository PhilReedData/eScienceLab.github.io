The Carpentries are piloting the new [Lesson Developer Trainer Training](https://github.com/carpentries/lessondev-trainer-training). The main objective of the Trainer Training is to prepare 
attendes to teach [Collaborative Lesson Development Training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/) to members of The Carpentries community. 
A secondary objective is to gather feedback on the Collaborative Lesson Development Training curriculum itself and to ensure that new trainers are all able to contribute to it in future. 

Trainer Training operate as follows:

1. Training runs for seven weeks. 
2. Training is focussed around weekly, hour-long discussion calls facilitated by experienced lesson development trainers.
3. Trainees are asked to complete various reading tasks and, occasionally, other homework assignments, in preparation for these discussion calls.

Lesson Developer Trainer Training is developed and run by The Carpentries, with the help from 
[Software Sustainability Institute](https://esciencelab.org.uk/projects/ssi/)) and other community members. Read more on [Collaborative Lesson Development Training](https://esciencelab.org.uk/announcements/2023/04/14/collaborative-lesson-development-training/).
