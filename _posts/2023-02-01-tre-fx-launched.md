[TRE-FX](https://trefx.uk/) launched in February 2023, as one of the five Driver projects funded by UK Research and Innovation as part of the [DARE UK](https://dareuk.org.uk/) programme _Data and Analytics Research Environments UK_. 

The DARE driver projects will take a leading role in informing the design of what will be a UK-wide network of _trusted research environments_ (TREs) – highly secure digital environments that provide access to sensitive data for analysis by accredited researchers. This is to support cross-domain data research for public good – for example, research about education, health, the environment and more, and how these different aspects of our lives interact with each other.

The TRE-FX project is [lead by eScience Lab](https://esciencelab.org.uk/projects/tre-fx/) at The University of Manchester together with University of Nottingham and partners including Health Data Research UK (HDR UK), University of Dundee, University of Swansea, University of Liverpool, University of Birmingham, University of Liverpool, Bitfount  and Birmingham University Hospitals NHS Trust.

The projects will take a leading role in informing the design of what will be a UK-wide network of trusted research environments (TREs) – highly secure digital environments that provide access to sensitive data for analysis by accredited researchers. This is to support cross-domain data research for public good – for example, research about education, health, the environment and more, and how these different aspects of our lives interact with each other.

In TRE-FX, we are assembling leading technology providers from [ELIXIR-UK](https://elixiruknode.org/) and [HDR UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/), with three TRE providers and two leading analysis platforms to show through a real reference implementation how we can use secure [Research Objects](/products/researchobject/) to move between TREs, while still supporting the Five Safes principles that govern and protect patient data; called the [Five Safes RO-Crate](https://trefx.uk/implementation).
