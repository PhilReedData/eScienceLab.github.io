> A BioCommons infrastructure for UK life science researchers

We are excited to share the [funding announcement](https://www.ukri.org/news/ukri-invests-72-million-upgrading-uk-research-infrastructure/) from UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) including Â£34 million for the creation of **BioFAIR**. 


[BioFAIR](https://biofair.uk/) was conceived by [ELIXIR-UK](https://elixiruknode.org/) and is a new digital research infrastructure that enables the data and processing resources of ELIXIR and other partners to be delivered to researchers across the UK. A national BioCommons will maximise the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability (FAIR) and Reproducibility of life science data and data workflows.

This need for BioFAIR is supported by the outcomes of a [Feasibility Study](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7924339) commissioned to ELIXIR-UK by UKRI-BBSRC, UKRI-MRC and Wellcome Trust, and carried out with Technopolis Group. 

Establishment of BioFAIR is funded by UKRI for the next 5 years (subject to business case approvals.
