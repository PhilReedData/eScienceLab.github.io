ELIXIR-CONVERGE was a project funded by the European Commission to help standardise life science data management across Europe. 
To achieve this standardisation, the project developed the [Research Data Management Toolkit](/products/rdmkit/) for life scientists.

The data management toolkit help ensure more research data is in the public domain, which will give scientists access to more data. 
This allow them to discover new insights into the challenges facing society, such as food security and health in old age, 
and help stimulate innovation in biomedicine and biotechnology.

ELIXIR-CONVERGE developed the national operations of the research infrastructure to drive good data management, 
reproducibility and reuse. With partners from 23 ELIXIR Nodes, over 36 months ELIXIR-CONVERGE takes the next step to create a European data federation where interconnected national operations allow users to extract knowledge from life scienceâ€™s large, 
diverse and distributed datasets.
