Integrated SERVices supporting a sustainable AGROecological transition (AgroServ) will facilitate a systemic and
holistic approach to understand the threats and challenges agriculture is facing, towards the implementation of a
resilient and sustainable agri-food system. The project proposes a transdisciplinary offer of services, integrating the
actors of the agriculture system in the research process, of which the farmers are the first, thanks to a wide offer of
living labs across Europe. 

Funded by [HORIZON-INFRA-2021-SERV-01-02](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-infra-2021-serv-01-02) 101058020, AgroServ will develop a wider catalogue of integrated and customised services, providing a strong
community building and training programme for access managers and users. Results from the research performed under
AgroServ will be synthesised to be used in the scope of evidence-based policy making. Data from AgroServ will be open and
compliant with FAIR practices, and made available on the long-term to the communities, and be linked with European
initiatives, such as the [EOSC](https://eosc-portal.eu/about/eosc).

## eScienceLab involvement

The eScience Lab is one of over 70 partners involved in this project, and will bring expertise
from [RDMKit](/products/rdmkit), [IBISBA](/projects/ibisba) and [FAIRDOM-SEEK](/products/seek) and build upon that work.

UK partners in Horizon Europe projects are funded through [Innovate UK](https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/) (#10038927) from the [UKRI Horizon Europe guarantee](https://www.ukri.org/apply-for-funding/apply-for-horizon-europe-guarantee-funding/).
