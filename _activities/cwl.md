The **[Common Workflow Language](http://www.commonwl.org/) (CWL)** is a community-led specification to express portable workflow and tool descriptions, which can be executed by multiple leading [workflow engine implementations](http://www.commonwl.org/#Implementations). Unlike previous standardisation attempts, CWL has taken a pragmatic approach and focused on what most workflow systems are able to do: *Execute command line tools and pass files around in a top-to-bottom pipeline.* At the heart of CWL workflows are the tool descriptions. A command line is described, with parameters, input and output files, in a [YAML format](http://www.commonwl.org/v1.0/UserGuide.html#Wrapping_Command_Line_Tools) so they can be shared across workflows and linked to from registries like [ELIXIR](/projects/elixir/)’s [bio.tools](https://bio.tools/). These are then combined and wired together in a second YAML file to form a [workflow template](http://www.commonwl.org/v1.0/UserGuide.html#Writing_Workflows), which can be executed on any of the supported implementations, repeatedly and on different platforms by specifying input files and workflow parameters. The [CWL User Guide](http://www.commonwl.org/v1.0/UserGuide.html) gives a gentle introduction to the language, while the more detailed [CWL specifications](http://www.commonwl.org/v1.0/) formalize CWL concepts so they can be implemented by the different workflow systems.

The eScience Lab have participated in the CWL project since its early days, contributing with our workflow and reproducibility expertise from [Apache Taverna](/products/taverna/), [Research Objects](/products/researchobjects/) and [myExperiment](/products/myexperiment/). The [CWL Viewer](/products/cwlviewer/), developed by the eScience Lab with support from [BioExcel](/projects/bioexcel/), provides a graphical visualization of CWL workflows.
