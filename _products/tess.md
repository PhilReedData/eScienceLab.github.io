TeSS (Training eSupport System) is a portal for aggregating, discovering, organising and diseminating pre-existing training resources (events and materials), primarily by aggregating training information metadata from <a href="http://www.elixir-europe.org/">ELIXIR</a> nodes but also from various 3rd-party content providers. TeSS is not a repository (it does not store original resources), rather it is a metadata registry (storing metadata and links to resources) providing centralised, coherent, curated and searchable access to training resources to:

 * Trainees (to aid training of researchers and professionals)
 * Trainers (to expose training materials created by trainers)
 * ELIXIR nodes (to provide a 1-stop-shop giving an at-a-glance view of nodesâ€™ training landscape, allowing nodes to contribute to the catalogue of training resources and promote their latest news, events, activity highlights, etc.)

 TeSS was originally funded though the [ELIXIR EXCELERATE project](/projects/excelerate). It is written in Ruby on Rails.
