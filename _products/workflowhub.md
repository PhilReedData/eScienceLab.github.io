WorkflowHub is a workflow system-agnostic registry of scientific workflows. 
It follows an open-development model, with regular community meetings held to steer the project's direction.
The inspiration for WorkflowHub came from [myExperiment](/products/myexperiment/).

In accordance with FAIR principles, WorkflowHub makes extensive use of open standards and tools such as [Common Workflow Language](https://www.commonwl.org/), [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/), [BioSchemas](https://bioschemas.org/), 
[TRS](https://about.workflowhub.eu/TRS/) in order to facilitate discovery and re-use of workflows in an accessible and interoperable way.

WorkflowHub is written in Ruby on Rails, and is based on the [FAIRDOM-SEEK](/products/seek/) codebase.

WorkflowHub's initial development was part of [EOSC-Life](/projects/eosclife/), following prototypes within [IBISBA](/project/ibisba/) and [BioExcel](/project/bioexcel/). The initial launch of WorkflowHub was pushed forward to provide <https://covid19.workflowhub.eu/> for COVID-19 workflows.

The hub development is now supported by [BY-COVID](/projects/by-covid), [EuroScienceGateway](/project/eurosciencegateway/), [TRE-FX](/projects/tre-fx/), [AgroServ](/projects/agroserv), [BioDT](/projects/biodt/), [BioIndustry4.0](/projects/bioindustry-4.0/), and is heavily used by other [ELIXIR](/projects/elixir) activities.

WorkflowHub is a collaborative open project, see the full list of [acknowledgements](https://about.workflowhub.eu/project/acknowledgements/).
