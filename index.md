The [eScience Lab](/about/) research group is led by [Professor Carole Goble](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/Carole.goble/). The group is based at the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/),  [University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk). It's affiliated with the wider [Information Management Group](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/img/).

The [eScience Lab team](/people/) are focused on research and development around a set of tools designed for data driven and computational research. The tools support the coming together of people, data and methods in a particular research area; supporting domains as diverse as systems biology, social science, music, astronomy, multimedia and chemistry. The [tools](/products/) have been adopted by a large number of projects and institutions.

Of particular focus in our work is to support practices and methodologies for researchers to follow the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), not just for publishing research data with rich metadata, but for ensuring computational methods can also be shared in a fully described and reproducible manner.

Our [research](/publications/) and [projects](/projects/) span a wide array of topics, including eScience, bioinformatics, biodiversity, scholarly communication, reproducible science, linked data, provenance, community building and knowledge representation.
