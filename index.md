The [eScience Lab](/about/) research group is led by [Carole Goble](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/carole.goble) and [Stian Soiland-Reyes](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/soiland-reyes). The group is based at the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/),  [University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk). It's affiliated with the wider [Information Management Group](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/img/).

The [eScience Lab team](/people/) are focused on the research and development of products and practices designed for data driven and computational research. The eScience  [tools](/products/) and techniques support the coming together of people, data and methods, the sharing of the research objects of science and the automation of analysis and data pipelines using computational workflows.

Our work can be called "Translational Computer Science" as we innovate solutions using state of the art knowledge
approaches but also produce and run production services and resources for Digital Research Infrastructures, particularly
those in the Biomedical Sciences and Biodiversity. Our tools and techniques have been adopted by a large number of
[projects](/projects/)  and institutions across Europe and internationally, as well as national organisations.

Of particular focus in our work is to support practices and methodologies for researchers to follow the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), not just for publishing research data with rich metadata, but for ensuring computational methods can also be shared in a fully described and reproducible manner.

The [research](/publications/) by the eScience Lab spans a wide array of topics, including FAIR and Open Research, computational workflows, scholarly communication, reproducible science, linked data, provenance, knowledge representation and
community building. Lab members are leaders in international standards setting and community groups working on digital
research infrastructure for science.
